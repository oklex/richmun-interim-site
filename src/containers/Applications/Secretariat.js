			<h2>About RichMUN</h2>
			<p>
				Founded in the 2014-2015 school year, we have always valued the social
				and community-driven aspects of Model UN. After the cancellation of
				April 2020's conference due to Covid 19, this upcoming year's RichMUN
				will be inviting previous staff to carry on their position and topics.
				With these changes, come new benefits and challenges, as well as the
				opportunity for a new Secretariat team to guide the conference into
				something new.
			</p>

			<div className="topSpacing" />
			<h2>Secretariat Expectations</h2>
			<p>
				We define professionalism as being both respectful and practical; and
				that neither should come at the cost of the other. All Secretariat are
				expected to treat staff and delegates with respect and strive towards
				effective collaboration.
			</p>

			<div className="topSpacing" />
			<h2>Application Information</h2>
			<p>
				1. You will be allowed to save and edit your application at any point
				within the form. However, if your application is not "complete" by the
				deadline, it will not be considered.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. You will also be allowed to apply for multiple positions at once -
				please review the available positions below.
			</p>
			<p>
				3. Your appeal as an potential secretariat is measured by what you are
				capable of and how you can benefit your team (similarly, harmful
				leadership practices will reduce your appeal).
			</p>
			<p>
				4. We are ultimately an educational organization and care about
				providing opportunities. If two applicants are deemed to be equally
				viable candidates, we give slight preference to applicants with less
				experience. To keep your application competitive, try to emphasize the
				skills and growth from past experiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				5. While we do our best to evaluate you fairly and reasonably, weâ€™re
				generally cautious when hiring, and it is your responsibility to put
				your best foot forward and help us evaluate you.
